## 🧠 The 5 Concepts Explained in 30 Seconds Each

### 1. **Priority vs Severity** 🎯
**Severity** = Technical Impact (How broken?)
**Priority** = Business Urgency (How urgent?)
**Key:** They don't always align!
**Example:** Typo (low severity) on homepage (high priority)

### 2. **DOR vs DOD** ✅
**DOR** (Definition of Ready) = Before work starts, is it ready?
**DOD** (Definition of Done) = After work, is it production-ready?
**Key:** Both gates prevent chaos!

### 3. **Planning vs Analysis** 📊
**Planning** = "What are we doing?" (Big picture, approval)
**Analysis** = "How are we doing it?" (Details, execution)
**Key:** Different phases, both essential!

### 4. **Smoke vs Sanity** 🧪
**Smoke** = Quick deployment check (5-15 min, fails = stop)
**Sanity** = Deep feature check (30-60 min, all scenarios)
**Key:** Smoke first, THEN sanity!

### 5. **Defect Management** 🐛
**Lifecycle:** NEW → OPEN → IN PROGRESS → RESOLVED → VERIFIED → CLOSED
**Report:** Title, Severity, Priority, Environment, Steps, Expected, Actual, Evidence
**Key:** Professional communication = Your value!
