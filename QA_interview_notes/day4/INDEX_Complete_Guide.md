## 🎓 Your Interview Answers (Ready to Use)

### Q: "Explain severity and priority"
**Your Answer:** "Severity is technical impact. Priority is business impact. They're independent.

Example: Typo in payment email has LOW severity (system works) but CRITICAL priority (all users see it, affects brand).

Another example: App crash on huge reports has CRITICAL severity (broken) but MAJOR priority (only 5% affected, workaround exists).

The business determines priority. That's what matters for scheduling."

---

### Q: "What is DOR and DOD?"
**Your Answer:** "DOR (Definition of Ready) ensures requirements are READY BEFORE development starts. DOD (Definition of Done) ensures work is READY FOR PRODUCTION after development.

DOR prevents: Starting work on unclear requirements (saves hours of questions)
DOD prevents: Deploying buggy code (prevents production issues)

Example: A registration story isn't READY (DOR) until it has acceptance criteria, designs, and test data. It isn't DONE (DOD) until tests pass, security review is complete, and performance is verified.

Together they ensure: clear requirements → good development → production ready"

---

### Q: "When would you send a story back as NOT READY?"
**Your Answer:** "When it lacks clear acceptance criteria, attached designs, or identified dependencies.

I had a story that just said 'Fix the dashboard'. No acceptance criteria, no definition of 'broken', no designs. I sent it back. The product owner came back with: 'Dashboard loads slowly. Target: <2 seconds. Optimize queries and APIs. Design: dashboard-redesign.png attached'. THEN it was ready."

---

### Q: "When would you say something is NOT DONE?"
**Your Answer:** "When DOD checklist items aren't complete. I had a registration feature that developer said was 'done' - code written, works on Chrome. But checking DOD:
- ✗ No automated tests
- ✗ No security review (we found SQL injection!)
- ✗ No performance testing
- ✗ Only tested on one browser

I sent it back. Dev added unit tests, security review, performance tests, multi-browser testing. THEN it was actually done and safe for production."
