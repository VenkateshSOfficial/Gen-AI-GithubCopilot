1. User Story
As a customer, I want to disable address auto-suggestions during checkout, so I can enter my address without interruption.

2. Description:
During the checkout process, customers may prefer to manually enter their full address without interruptions by auto-suggestions. This user story allows customers to disable the address auto-suggestion feature, providing a more streamlined experience for those who prefer manual entry. This is particularly useful for customers with unusual addresses or those who find auto-suggestions distracting.

3. Technical Notes
User Interface: The option to disable suggestions should be a clearly labeled toggle switch (e.g., "Enable Auto-Suggestions") near the address input fields. The default state should be enabled.
4. Persistence:
For logged-in users, the preference (enabled/disabled) should be saved to their account profile and persist across sessions and devices.
For guest users, the preference should be stored in session storage and persist only for the duration of the current checkout session. If the session expires, the preference should reset to the default (enabled).
Address Validation: Address validation (e.g., checking for valid postal codes, city/state combinations) should always occur, regardless of whether auto-suggestions are enabled or disabled. This is a separate feature.
Accessibility: The toggle switch must be fully accessible via keyboard navigation and screen readers, adhering to WCAG guidelines. Appropriate ARIA attributes should be used.
Performance: Disabling/enabling suggestions should not introduce any noticeable performance lag.
Logging: Log events related to enabling or disabling the feature, and the source of the address (manual entry vs. suggestion selection) for analytics and debugging.
API: If address suggestions are provided by a third-party API, ensure the ability to bypass or suppress the API calls when suggestions are disabled.
